# Kenzie Hub API

This project serves as an API for my prior work: Kenzie Hub, a React application.

Kenzie Hub is designed to help users track the technologies they've learned, along with their current proficiency level in each one. After signing up on Kenzie Hub, users can immediately start logging their progress.

This API was built utilizing the following technologies:

- Nest.js
- Jest
- TypeScript
- class-validator
- passport-jwt

In the future, I plan to expand the test coverage to reach 100%, incorporate Docker and Swagger, and add additional routes for creating and deleting user-associated technologies.
